### What it is

This is an AHK script that allows you to rebind native hotkeys from the game to keys you prefer and adds a handful of new shortcuts to make the gameplay smoother and more fun.

### How it works

I've rebound some of the keys to more fitting and easier to reach positions. Feel free to change the keys to your liking.

#### List of shortcuts


doors:
- ToggleLeftDoor: a
- ToggleRightDoor: d

vents:
- ToggleForwardVent: y
- ToggleSideVent: f

other:
- ToggleFlashlight: s
- ToggleMonitor: w
- ToggleDeskFan: space

random:
- CatchFish: c
- CloseAd: q

bonus:
- ToggleMask: e
- ToggleVentilation: r
- EnterCamSystem: Shift+1
- EnterVentSystem: Shift+2
- EnterDuctSystem: Shift+3

To change any keys simply open the main file, look for the function you want to remap and overwrite the letter.

### How to install

All you need is a working installation of AHK (Auto Hotkey) v2 and the files provided under the releases section.

If you haven't installed AHK yet, procede to the [official site](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and follow the instructions there.

Afterwards, simply run the main script and you're good to go.

### Troubleshooting

The mod works with locations on the screen instead of directly interacting with the objects in the game. Therefore, if you're using this on a monitor with a different resolution some shortcuts might not work.
All positions adapt to different resolutions, but depending on how the game treats the rescaling process some positions may be slightly off. In that case, feel free to modify the positions at the top of the file, if at all they should be only slightly off and only small adjustments should be needed to get everything working again.

If you're playing on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution everything should work perfectly regardless.
